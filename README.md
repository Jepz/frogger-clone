# Frogger game
My first take on a frogger game! Based on Udacity Front end developer course.


## How to get it up and running
All you need to do is download the and run it by opening the index.html.

### Let's get playing!
It's simple, use the keyboards arrowkeys to move your character up,down,left,right.
If you get hit by any bugs or get to the otherside, the game restarts.

Enjoy!
